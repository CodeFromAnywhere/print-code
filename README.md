Now you can finally take your entire codebase and print it with the printer so you can start reading it outside in the sun! ☀️

TODO:

- Put a github auth in front of it to select repos to print or selections thereof
- Put fn in front that extracts all your recent apis you've been working on from your github and renders docs for it
- Put pdf generator behind that loads the html and saves as pdf, then responds with URL of the PDF to download with a given TTL
- Serve this as API
- Connect with print delivery API and pricing to deliver weekly.
